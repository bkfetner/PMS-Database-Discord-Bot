# Payment Management System with Discord Integration

## Overview

Welcome to the Payment Management System! This project showcases the possibilities of a versatile payment management system that harnesses the power of a relational database and can be seamlessly accessed through a Discord bot. While the current implementation features a subset of functionalities, it serves as an example of the system's vast potential.

## Demonstrated Features

- **Relational Database:** Our system demonstrates the use of a relational database to store and manage payment data efficiently.

- **Discord Bot Integration:** Access the system through a Discord bot, providing a glimpse into the user-friendly interface for managing payments and transactions.

- **Basic Commands:** The Discord bot showcases basic commands for viewing certain sets of information, offering a preview of what's possible with the discord commands.

## Technologies Used

This project makes use of the following technologies:

- **SQL (Structured Query Language):** Utilized for managing a relational database, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of payment data.

- **JavaScript:** Powers the Discord bot integration, providing the logic and interactivity for user-friendly payment management.

- **Discord Bots:** Leveraged to create a seamless interface for users to interact with the payment management system directly through Discord, offering convenience and accessibility.

These technologies work in harmony to create a flexible and extensible payment management system with the potential for further customization and feature expansion.
